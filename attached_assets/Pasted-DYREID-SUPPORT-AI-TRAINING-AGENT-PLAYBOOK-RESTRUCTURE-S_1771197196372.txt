DYREID SUPPORT AI — TRAINING AGENT PLAYBOOK RESTRUCTURE (STEP 1)

We are preparing to import historical DyreID support tickets from the Pureservice API into our 9-step training pipeline.

However, the current implementation of Step 6 (Resolution Extraction) extracts and stores natural-language resolution text from support tickets.

This is incorrect for our system.

DyreID Support AI is not an informational chatbot.

It is a stateful action agent that performs authenticated operations via OTP login to Min Side, such as:

Ownership transfer

Lost pet reporting

QR tag activation

Smart Tag linking

Subscription management

Foreign chip registration

Therefore:

The Playbook must not store generated customer answers or agent phrasing.

It must instead store structured operational data that can later be executed by the runtime chatbot after OTP authentication.

🚨 CURRENT PROBLEM

Step 6 of the training pipeline currently extracts:

Agent reply text

Natural-language instructions

Resolution phrasing

Example (current):

"Agent asked the customer to log in and register the new owner"

This is not usable by the runtime action agent.

Runtime must instead know:

What the customer wanted

Whether the issue required system action

What data was needed

What Min Side endpoint should be triggered

🎯 REQUIRED CHANGE

Update Step 6 — Resolution Extraction
so that the training agent builds Playbook entries using the following schema:

NEW PLAYBOOK ENTRY STRUCTURE
interface PlaybookEntry {
  intent: string;
  actionable: boolean;
  requiredData: string[];
  actionEndpoint?: string;
  guidanceSteps?: string[];
  infoText?: string;
}
🧠 OPENAI TRAINING TASK

When analyzing a resolved support ticket, OpenAI must now determine:

What was the customer's operational goal?

Examples:

Transfer ownership
Activate QR tag
Report lost pet
Cancel subscription
Register foreign chip
Update contact info

Was the issue resolved by performing an authenticated system action inside DyreID systems?

IF YES (ACTION REQUIRED)

Then:

actionable = true

Extract:

requiredData needed to perform the operation
Examples:

PetId
NewOwnerMobile
TagId
SubscriptionId
OwnerMobile
ChipNumber

Then map the ticket resolution to the corresponding Min Side operation:

Examples:

OwnershipTransferWeb
→ /OwnerChange/OwnerSeller/ReportOwnerChange

LostPetReport
→ /Pet/LostPet/ReportLostPet

QRTagActivation
→ /Pet/QR/Activate

CancelSubscription
→ /Subscription/Cancel

ForeignChipRegistration
→ /Pet/Foreign/Register

Store:

intent
actionable
requiredData
actionEndpoint

IF NO (INFORMATIONAL ONLY)

Examples:

price questions

subscription explanation

app features

general how-to questions

DyreID+ explanation

Then:

actionable = false
store resolution in infoText only

Do not store requiredData or endpoint.

IMPORTANT RULES

OpenAI must NOT:

generate customer-facing answers

store conversational phrasing

describe procedures in free text

OpenAI must ONLY extract:

intent
actionability
requiredData
endpoint mapping

RUNTIME REQUIREMENT

The runtime chatbot will later:

If actionable = true
→ collect requiredData from user
→ execute actionEndpoint via OTP Min Side session

If actionable = false
→ INFORM using infoText

IMPLEMENTATION TASK

Update:

Step 6 — Resolution Extraction
Playbook storage logic
Database schema for PlaybookEntry

so that Playbook entries are now operationally structured
instead of storing natural-language agent replies.

DO NOT IMPORT SUPPORT TICKETS

until this schema is implemented.
